<h2>What's happening here?</h2>
This small project is my first humble step into the world of Machine Learning. I've played around 
with the MNIST handwritten numbers dataset, and then created a simple console App that tries to 
recognize the number in the picture at the path you provide using the data from the trained model.

**Important:**
If you clone this repo wishing to run the App on your own PC, please **do NOT run** any file 
except *AppMain.py*!
